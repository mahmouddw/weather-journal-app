# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
I have modified the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and I used `style.css` to style the application to customized perfection.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS and Express (Framework).
